# Create: Advanced Schedules

This Create extension aims to expand the capabilities of the train schedules. In theory, this mod should be able to make train navigation Turing-complete :)

- [ ] Adds a schedule command that functions similar to a GOTO statement, which jumps to a separate LABEL schedule command.
- [ ] Allows the GOTO statement to use the same or similar conditions as stations, but rather than waiting for the condition, the GOTO only activates if the condition is already met. This might require special handling of DELAY or similar conditions.
- [ ] Allow the use of regex in destination commands. While this is already technically possible, it's unnecessarily complicated and shows up ugly on display links. By adding a checkbox to enable regex and a text box to customise how the destination will be displayed, this should be much more usable.
- [ ] Add more advanced conditions, such as using the number of days that have passed in the world.

More ideas welcome!
